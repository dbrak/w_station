1. Create a new repository on github

2.  Close existing project to get the welcome screen.  From there you should see a selection to check out from version control.  Use that to check the new repository out.

3. Enter Project Preferences and update versions for Pip and Setuptools

4. Install packages:
    - PyQt5
    - firebase-admin
    - grpcio
    - pigpio
    - 
    
5. In Preferences > Version Control > Ignored Files, add *.xml, *.json and *.iml files. That should clear all of your untracked changes in the files.

6.  Then pull the remote repository.
