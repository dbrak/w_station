A short markdown file about to use version control generally and github
 specifically in pycharm.

# VCS Operations Menu
Many VCS operations are available via with pop-up menu.  Accessible
via a keyboard command.

- ctrl v - VCS Operations Menu

# The Git Menu
Most of the management tools around git are not on the default menu.  To
find them you need to go into preference (cmd ,) and add them to the main
menu.

Even with this menu enabled some simple function (like pull) are hidden on
the repository submenu but at least it is possible to find.


# Push Code
Pushing code is buried under the commit button.  Knowing the key board
commands is useful.

- cmd k - Commit
- shift cmd k - push
