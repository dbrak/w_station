1. Create a new repository on github

2.  Close existing project to get the welcome screen.  From there you should see a selection to check out from version control.  Use that to check the new repository out.

3. Confirm that the project interpreter is Python 3.7.

4. Enter Project Preferences and update versions for Pip and Setuptools

5. Install packages:
    - PyQt5
    - firebase-admin
    - grpcio
    - pigpio
    - statistics
    - bokeh
    
6. In Preferences > Version Control > Ignored Files, add *.xml, *.json and *.iml files. That should clear all of your untracked changes in the files.

7.  Pull the remote repository.
