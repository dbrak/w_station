In pycharm, if you want to change the python interpreter your project is
 using or manage the packages installed in the virtual environment, you
 can manage this from the preferences.

 - Preferences are on the pycharm menu or can be accessed via the keyboard
 shortcut: cmd,
 - In preferences, under "Project: <Project_Name>" the first choice will be
 Project Interpreter.  This will have a pulldown at the top for python environments
 running different versions of python and a table of the installed packages.
 - To install new packages, click the "+" on the bottom of the package window
 - To update the version of a package, click "+" as if you are installing
 a new package but specify the version number to be installed.  If you don't
 sepecify the version number, it will install the same version again.
